# Onboarding-Manual-Testing
Story
First of all, we'd like to congratulate you again for being part of Codecool! The following months will be really exciting, and we can't wait to start working with you!

Let's get down to business quickly. We'd like to ask you to read this page entirely and carefully as it contains a lot of really important information and needs some actions from you.

In Codecool, the curriculum is organized around projects. Everything is a project, even - as you see - the onboarding what you're doing right now. Projects have a standard structure (like this page) and tasks with acceptance criteria to fulfill. So it should be clear for you what you have to do.

What are you going to learn?
set up Journey (our Learning Management System)
join the communication channels in Codecool (email and instant messaging)
join to GitHub
get to know to some productivity tips in Gmail and Google Calendar (we're not affiliated with Google just use their products because we found them useful)
learn about Codecool's Manifesto, Methodology, and Code of ethics.
As we find practice crucial and we believe experience first, understand later, we ask you to do the following tasks. Of course, feel free to search and ask, and also the background materials at the bottom of the page could be of help.
